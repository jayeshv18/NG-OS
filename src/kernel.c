     *A normal program when your main() function finishes, it executes a return statement. This returns control back to the operating system's kernel,
     *which securely cleans up the memory and closes the process. Since we are writing the operating system itself, there is nothing left to return to.
     *Since our kernel has no host OS to return to, exiting this function would cause a fatal system crash.
     *To prevent this, we enter an infinite loop that uses the raw assembly "hlt" (Halt) instruction.
     *This safely puts the CPU into a low-power sleep state instead of spinning at 100% usage and generating heat.
     *If a hardware interrupt wakes the processor up, the loop immediately forces it back to sleep safely.
